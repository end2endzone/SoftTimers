Changes for 1.2.0:

* Source code now depends on win32Arduino third party library available at http://github.com/end2endzone/win32Arduino
* First github release.
* Code originally release at http://www.end2endzone.com/softtimers-a-collection-of-software-timers-to-easily-compute-elapsed-time-since-an-event-occured/


Changes for 1.1.0:

* Fixed a bug where uninitialized timeout time would return incorrect results.
* Added support for using an external counting function. This also allows the same class (SoftTimer)
  to support both milliseconds and microseconds.
* Implemented progress and looping support. See getProgress(), getLoopCount() and getLoopProgress()
* Implemented support for remaining time. See getRemainingTime()
* Created new unit tests using win32Arduino library available at:
  http://www.end2endzone.com/win32arduino-a-win32-library-that-implements-most-arduino-functions/
* Added many new examples to show possible use of the library.
