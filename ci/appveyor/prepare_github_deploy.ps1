#Script for preparing for GitHub deploy.

#For prerelease branches:
#  Every commits to a prerelease branch is tagged and binaries are deployed to GitHub.
#For non-prerelease branches:
#  Each other branches (including master) are build after each commits.
#  One version of the latest binaries is kept per branch (allow 1 public nightly build per branch)
#  A dummy tag is created named: nightly-$(BRANCH_NAME). This seems to be required by GitHub.
#  The version number of a non-prerelease branch is truncated from format x.y.z.b to format x.y.z instead.
#  This is to allow release binaries collisions which overrides the previous uploads allowing to only keep the last commits.
#  It also prevents collisions with actual releases of prerelease branches.
